            <b>Agate</b> was the second stone in the third row of the breastplate and thought to represent the Aser tribe of the Israelites. The stone was associated with health, longevity, and wealth. It was brought to Palestine by merchants from places such as Babylonia, Persia, Saba, and Reema in their caravans (Ezekiel 27:22). Agate was considered to have medicinal powers into the Middle Ages, supposedly countering poisons, contagious diseases, and fever. Agate comes in various bright colors. Red agate was meant to improve eyesight.
